
a repository containing idiomatic ASP-style template parsers.
these parsers use plain, old, manual parsing. no regular expressions involved!

root-impl is the C++-version, in 'c++/', most other are deriatives of that one.

If you plan to use one of these parsers in your project, you're well advised to
modify them to fit your needs; they're intended to showcase the algorithm, but not
to provide a generic library.

License: not sure yet, but I guess public domain. ask me if you have any questions.

More implementations may follow eventually.
